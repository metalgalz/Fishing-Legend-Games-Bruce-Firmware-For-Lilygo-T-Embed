## **🚀 Quick Installation Guide (Beginner Friendly)**

### **1\. Prepare your Device**

* **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED**: Use **Bruce Firmware** for the Lilygo T-Embed. This game is optimized to run smoothly on it.

...      ├── fish.json  
...      ├── rod.json  
...      ├── charm.json  
...      ├── money.json  
...      └── level.json

1. **Download** the /FishingLegendDB folder from this repository.  
2. **Paste** the folder into the main (root) directory of your SD Card.  
3. **Copy & Rename**: Save your chosen game file as fishing\_legend.js (or main.js depending on your setup) on the SD Card root.  
4. **Insert** the SD Card into your T-Embed.

### **3\. Play\!**

* Turn on your device.  
* Launch the app (if using Bruce, usually found in the Script/App manager).

* This means a fish bit the hook\!

### **Step 3: Catch It\! (Reeling)**

## **🌟 Exclusive Features (New Update 2026-01-21)**

## **⚔️ Game Secrets & Tips**

### **🌈 The "Pity" System (Durability Luck)**

Your Fishing Rod gets damaged over time. **Don't fix it immediately\!**

* **Damaged Rod (50%)** \= **Green/Fast Rainbow Bobber** (+20% Luck)  
* **Broken Rod (25%)** \= **Hyper Speed Rainbow Bobber** (+45% Luck)

**Pro Tip:** Use a broken rod to catch the rarest fish (Mythic/Secret)\!

### **📈 Economy Tips**

* **Level Requirements**: Some powerful rods in the shop require a specific Player Level to buy.  
* **Inflation**: As you level up, fish give more EXP, but high-tier rods cost millions. Save your money\!
